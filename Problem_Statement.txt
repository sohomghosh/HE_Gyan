Description : Dataset contains extensive data about games
released on di†erent platforms over the last twenty years.

[Problem Statement]
Analyze and list the platforms with the most "Editor's Choice"
awards? Does number of games by a platform in a given year
have any e†ect on these awards? What is Macintosh's average

Use the data to build a predictive model to predict which games
will get "Editor's Choice" awards in a given year? What attributes
are the strongest predictors of whether a game will get an award?
Please explain your analysis in simple english. Plot graphs if you
have to visualize your analysis. Provide outputs from models that
you generate (e.g. coe†cients).
